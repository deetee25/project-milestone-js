## How does this work?

This is a web app build with **HTML** - **CSS** - **JS**, it uses a **REST API** and the endpoints are provided by [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) to fetch the data of different countries.

#### All the below parameters are fetched from the REST API we've used:

    - Flag
    - Capital city
    - Dialing code
    - Population
    - Currencies
    - Region
    - Subregion

#### The country list is also getting the country data from the API we have used.
